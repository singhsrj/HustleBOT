'''A platform called "FarmLink" that connects small-scale farmers in rural areas with urban buyers and local restaurants,enabling them to sell their produce directly at fair prices. The app uses geolocation, vernacular language support,and a simple interface to help farmers list available produce. It also provides logistics coordination and real-time demand prediction using AI. This reduces exploitation by middlemen, ensures fresh farm-to-table supply, and increases farmers' incomes.The startup targets Indian tier-2 and tier-3 cities, with potential to scale across other developing countries'''
